# MNIST-neuronal-net
Writing a neuronal network to learn to recognize digits from the MNIST database.

The database provides 55.000 training sets and 10.000 test sets.

With a hidden layer of 160 nodes, learning rate of .2 and weights initialised
from a normal distribution I managed to get to a 97.1% accuracy.
